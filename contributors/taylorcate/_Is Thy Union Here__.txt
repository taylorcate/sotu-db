IS THY UNION HERE?[1]
By Taylor-Cate Brown


Dethroned from the first etched instance.
I, not a Sophomore but a Junior then,
Watched and listened to the mocking, maniacal 
Man claiming intel leaks from Mazda exhausts and
Motorcycles revving loud enough for our tormentors
To hear—unaccustomed to sprawling lawns but all too 
Familiar with booby-traps, amputations, and bare earth
Littered with the crutches we’ve thrown to a world losing its 
Leg to stand on. Gaping paramedics follow the 
Footprints of legends, but in an imploding timeline 
Only high stake holders survive—
Walmart, Softbank, Toyota—“Destroy ISIS,” he says, 
But the beast has many heads—
An opioid spine—and it breathes fear. 
Respiration fit for a world with no atmosphere. 
The quarterback throws the ball and waits
But doesn’t hear the resounding cheer. 
Turns out we were all there—gasping for air
Enough to shout—but the vile force of our own 
Complacency choked us out. Too much
Cajun spice I suppose...better make the call for 
Repose, but not until every last item on the 
Evergrowing agenda has been closed—
Or, rather, silenced like thy union.
